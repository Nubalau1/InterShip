# Anagram Finder

This program reads a list of words from an input file and groups words that are anagrams of each other. Each group is written to a new line in an output file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses only Python standard library)

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nubalau1/InterShip.git
cd InterShip
```

2. **Run the code**
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Check the output

The result will be written to output.txt, with each line containing a group of anagrams.
